# CryoMeasure
a sotware used for resistance vs. temperature measurements for our lab's [cryostat system]{}.
The gui is built using the [Eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel) library, and bootstrap.

##components
We have a keithley2400 and a keithley7001 for the 4-channel resistance measurements.
We use a Lakeshore diode and a voltmeter for temperature sensing,
and a respberry pi pico, a power supply and a L298N driver combined with a PID loop for temperature control.
